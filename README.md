# Design Patterns


### What is a Design Pattern?

We encounter problems in our day-to-day life and so as the programmers while designing or creating programs. Most of the times the problem faced can be categorised and people have found universal ways or patterns to solve these problems. And as a programmer, we also face problems; which can be classified and can be solved using patterns.
In other words, it can be stated as a solution to recurring problems that software engineers face often. And it is more like a procedure or description on how to resolve the issues and build an efficient solution.

### Types of design patterns
There are approximately 22 design patterns and  are grouped into 3 types:

1. Creational: 
These patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code.

2. Structural: These patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

3. Behavioral: These patterns are designed depending on how one class communicates with others.
